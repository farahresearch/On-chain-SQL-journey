# On-chain SQL Journey – LEFT JOIN Case Study

## Objective
Identify Ethereum addresses that **received ETH but never sent ETH**.

This analysis helps identify:
- Protocol contracts
- Treasury addresses
- Router and infrastructure contracts

---

## Dataset
- Source: `ethereum.transactions` (Dune Analytics)
- Chain: Ethereum Mainnet

---

## SQL Concept Used
**LEFT JOIN**

We join:
- All receivers (`to`)
- Against all senders (`from`)

And filter:
- Addresses that appear as receivers
- But never appear as senders

---

## Query Logic (High Level)
1. Extract all unique sender addresses
2. LEFT JOIN them against receiver addresses
3. Keep rows where sender is `NULL`
4. Count how many times each address received ETH

---

## Key Insight
Most top results are **smart contracts**, not EOAs, such as:
- Stablecoins (USDT, USDC)
- DEX routers
- Wrapped ETH contracts

This confirms that **LEFT JOIN is effective for contract behavior analysis**.
